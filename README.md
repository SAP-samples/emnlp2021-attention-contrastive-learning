In this repository we will provide the source code for the paper *Attention-based Contrastive Learning for Winograd Schemas* to be presented at  [EMNLP 2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/). The code is in parts based on the code from [Huggingface Tranformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and the paper [A Surprisingly Robust Trick for Winograd Schema Challenge](https://github.com/vid-koci/bert-commonsense).

## Abstract

![Schematic Illustration of Attentiomn Contrastive Learning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP-samples/emnlp2021-attention-contrastive-learning/main/img/attention_contrastive.png)

Self-supervised learning has recently attracted considerable attention in the NLP community for its ability to learn discriminative features using a contrastive objective. This paper investigates whether contrastive learning can be extended to Transfomer attention to tackling the Winograd Schema Challenge. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised framework, leveraging a *contrastive loss* directly at the level of *self-attention*. Experimental analysis of our attention-based models on multiple datasets demonstrates superior commonsense reasoning capabilities. The proposed approach outperforms all comparable unsupervised approaches while occasionally surpassing supervised ones.
